# LibICS

Incoherent Source Library


# Dependencies

Python dependencies required for the library functionality are specified
in the [setup](./setup.py) file, so package managers can automatically
install them.

Libraries providing extensions (or actual implementations) that not
necessarily all users need have to be installed separately. This chapter
gives an overview of these additional external dependencies.
